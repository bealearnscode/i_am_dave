# I am Dave

I am Dave is my first challenge app from [Angela Yu's The Complete 2020 Flutter Developement Bootcamp with Dart](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/)

## The Backstory
Many, many years ago, the Internet directed me to a Tumblr blog called [The Same Picture of Dave Coulier Every Day](https://samepicofdavecoulier.tumblr.com/). This is not clickbait, by friends. This blog has posted the exact same photo of Dave Coulier (Joey from Full House) every single day since its inception. It's brilliant.

I am continuing this blog's legacy by creating an app that does absolutely nothing...but spread the joy that is Dave Coulier. You're welcome.
